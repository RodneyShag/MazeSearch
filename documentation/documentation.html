<p>
In this assignment, you will build general search 
algorithms and apply them to different scenarios. In Part 1 (for everybody), you will be in 
charge of a "Pacman" agent that needs to find paths through mazes and avoid ghosts.
Part 2 (for four-unit students), you will tackle a more complex maze for food collection.

</p><p>As stated in the beginning of the course, <b>you are free to use any high-level programming language you are
comfortable with</b>. This includes (but is not limited to) Java, C++, Python, and MATLAB. The focus of this
course is on problem solving, not programming, and the grading will primarily be based on the quality of
your solutions and your analysis, as evidenced by your <b>written report</b>. 

</p><p><b>You have the option of working in groups of up to three people.</b> Three-unit students must work with
three-unit students and four-unit students must work with four-unit students. Four-unit groups have to complete
additional problems that are extra credit for everyone else. For more detail, see
<a href="http://slazebni.cs.illinois.edu/fall15/assignment1.html#submission"><b>submission instructions</b></a>.

<h2>Part 1: For everybody</h2>

<img src="./documentation_files/maze.jpg">

<h3>1.1 Basic pathfinding</h3>

To begin with, you will consider the problem of finding a path through a maze from
a given start state to a given goal state. This scenario is illustrated in the figure
above, where the start position is indicated by the "Pacman" icon and the goal state
is a dot. The maze layout will be given to you in a simple text format, where '%' 
stands for walls, 'P' for the starting position, and '.' for the goal
(see </a><a href="http://slazebni.cs.illinois.edu/fall15/assignment1/bigMaze.txt">sample maze file</a>). 
All step costs are equal to one.

<p>Implement the following search algorithms for solving different mazes:

</p><ul>
<li>Depth-first search;
</li><li>Breadth-first search;
</li><li>Greedy best-first search;
</li><li>A* search.
</li></ul>

For greedy and A* search, use the Manhattan distance from the current position to the goal
as the heuristic function.

<p>Run each of the above algorithms on the following inputs:
</p><ul>
<li><a href="http://slazebni.cs.illinois.edu/fall15/assignment1/mediumMaze.txt">Medium maze</a>; 
</li><li><a href="http://slazebni.cs.illinois.edu/fall15/assignment1/bigMaze.txt">Big maze</a>;
</li><li><a href="http://slazebni.cs.illinois.edu/fall15/assignment1/openMaze.txt">Open maze</a>.
</li></ul>
For each problem instance and each search algorithm, include the following in your report:

<ul>
<li>The solution, displayed by putting a '.' in every maze square visited on the
path (<a href="http://slazebni.cs.illinois.edu/fall15/assignment1/bigMaze_solution.txt">example solution</a> to the
<a href="http://slazebni.cs.illinois.edu/fall15/assignment1/bigMaze.txt">big maze</a>).
</li><li>The path cost of the solution, defined as the number of steps taken to get from the initial state to the goal state. 
</li><li>Number of nodes expanded by the search algorithm.
</li></ul>

<h3>1.2 Penalizing turns</h3>

Consider a modified problem formulation where Pacman's actions are defined as <em>move forward, turn left, and turn right,</em> and these actions can have different costs. "Move forward" takes Pacman one step in the direction he is facing, whereas any turn changes the direction he is facing 90 degrees to the left or right, respectively. Assume Pacman is initially facing right. Note that when Pacman turns, he does not change his position in that move, only the direction, and another "forward" move is needed to take him one step in the desired direction. Modify your code from 1.1 accordingly and run it on the mazes from part 1.1 to make sure you get the same output paths as in 1.1 when all actions have the same cost (there is no need to report anything for this, it is just a sanity check).

<p>Now consider the following two mazes:
</p><ul>
<li><a href="http://slazebni.cs.illinois.edu/fall15/assignment1/smallTurns.txt">Small maze</a>;
</li><li><a href="http://slazebni.cs.illinois.edu/fall15/assignment1/bigTurns.txt">Big maze</a>.
</li></ul>

<p> Run A* using Manhattan distance heuristic for the following two cases:
</p><ul>
<li>forward movement has cost 2 and any turn has cost 1;
</li><li>forward movement has cost 1 and any turn has cost 2.
</li></ul>

<p>Then design a different heuristic that is more informed than Manhattan distance for the new setting. Explain why it is admissible, explain why it is more informed, and run A* using your heuristic on the same mazes. Make sure your heuristic expands fewer nodes than Manhattan distance in both cases.

</p><p>For each of the eight cases (two mazes, two cases for each, two heuristics) report the solution costs and numbers of nodes expanded. Show your computed paths for each maze and cost function. Briefly discuss what you observe.

</p><h3>1.3 Pacman with a ghost</h3>

<p>Now go back to the action definition of 1.1, but assume that there is a ghost moving on a straight horizontal
line through the maze, between two walls.

</p><p>The ghost moves one square at a time, initially from left to right, unless there is a wall immediately to its right,
in which case the initial movement of the ghost is right to left. The ghost changes direction any time it encounters a wall
and keeps moving. Changing direction or attempting to move into a wall should not be considered a distinct movement of the ghost,
its location should always be one square away from its previous location. The ghost makes a move every time Pacman makes a move,
simultaneously. Any time Pacman occupies the same square as the ghost, or tries to "pass through" (swap spaces with) the ghost, the game ends: 
Pacman dies and the goal becomes unreachable.

</p><p>Run A* with Manhattan distance on the following mazes, where 'G' marks the initial position of the ghost
  and 'g' the ghost's path.

</p><ul>
<li><a href="http://slazebni.cs.illinois.edu/fall15/assignment1/smallGhost.txt">Small maze</a>;
</li><li><a href="http://slazebni.cs.illinois.edu/fall15/assignment1/mediumGhost.txt">Medium maze</a>;
</li><li><a href="http://slazebni.cs.illinois.edu/fall15/assignment1/bigGhost.txt">Big maze</a>.
</li></ul>

<p>For each maze, give the solution path, solution cost, and the number of nodes expanded. Compare these with A* search results 
on the same mazes but without the ghost.

</p><h4>For full credit, do one of the following (feel free to do more for extra credit):</h4>

<ul>
<li>Create nice animations showing the movements of the Pacman and the ghost. The animations can be included
in the zip file (but be sure to indicate in your report that we should look for them).<br><br>

</li><li>Design and implement a heuristic that is more informed than Manhattan distance for this problem.
This heuristic should preferably be admissible, but a non-admissible one is still OK as long as it works well.
Briefly show that your heuristic is more informed, and show the number of nodes expanded
by the two heuristics for each maze.<br><br>

</li><li>Create a new maze with more complicated ghost movement (or multiple ghosts) and find the solution. As above, compare this solution with
A* search results on the same maze but with no ghost(s). Try to make this environment as hard for the Pacman as possible -- that is, the length
of the solution path and the number of nodes expanded should be considerably higher than without the ghost. For this part, it is also
interesting (though not required) to consider advanced heuristics.<br><br>
</li></ul>

<a name="part2">
<h2>Part 2: For four-unit students</h2>

<h3>2.1 Search with multiple dots</h3>

Now consider a harder problem of finding the shortest path through a maze
while hitting multiple dots. Once again, the Pacman is initially at P, but now
there is no single goal position. Instead, the goal is achieved whenever the Pacman
manages to eat all the dots. Once again, we assume unit step costs.

<p>Revise your A* search code from Part 1 to
deal with this scenario. This will require changing the goal test (have you
eaten all the dots?) and the state representation (besides your current position
in the maze, is there anything else you need to know?). Run your A* search on the
following inputs:
</p></a><ul><a name="part2">
</a><li><a name="part2"></a><a href="http://slazebni.cs.illinois.edu/fall15/assignment1/tinySearch.txt">Tiny search</a>;
</li><li><a href="http://slazebni.cs.illinois.edu/fall15/assignment1/smallSearch.txt">Small search</a>;
</li><li><a href="http://slazebni.cs.illinois.edu/fall15/assignment1/mediumSearch.txt">Medium search</a>.
</li></ul>

<p>For this part of the assignment, it is crucial to design a good heuristic. For full credit, your heuristic should be admissible and should permit you to find the solution for the medium search in a reasonable amount of time. In your report, explain the heuristic you chose, and discuss whether it leads to an optimal solution.

</p><p>For each maze, give the solution cost and the number of nodes expanded.
Show your solution by numbering the goals in the order in which you
reach them (once you run out of numbers, use lowercase letters, and if you run out of those, uppercase letters). 

</p><h3>2.2 Suboptimal search</h3>

Sometimes, even with A* and a good heuristic, finding the optimal path through all the dots is hard. 
In these cases, we'd still like to find a reasonably good path, quickly. Write a suboptimal search 
algorithm that will do a good job on <a href="http://slazebni.cs.illinois.edu/fall15/assignment1/mediumDots.txt">this maze</a> and 
<a href="http://slazebni.cs.illinois.edu/fall15/assignment1/bigDots.txt">this maze</a>.

<p>Your algorithm could either be A* with a non-admissible heuristic, or something different altogether.
For full credit, you should expand fewer than 3000 nodes for the first maze and fewer than 72000 for the second, 
and get solution costs no larger than 190 for the first maze and no larger than 500 for the second.

</p><p>In your report, discuss your approach and output the solution cost and number of expanded nodes 
for each maze. You don't have to show the solution path unless
you want to come up with a nice animation for extra credit.

</p><h3>For extra credit</h3>

Design complicated mazes that combine multiple dots and ghosts, and create heuristics for solving these mazes.<br><br>


<a name="tips">
<h2>General tips</h2>

<ul>
<li> To form groups, feel free to use Piazza.
Needless to say, working in a group will not necessarily make your life easier, as the overhead of group 
coordination can easily outweigh the benefits.
<br><br>

</li><li> In your implementation, make sure you get all the bookkeeping right. This includes handling 
of repeated states (in particular, what happens when you find a better 
path to a state already on the frontier) and saving the optimal solution 
path. These topics have been extensively covered during the lectures.<br><br> 

</li><li> Pay attention to tiebreaking. If you have multiple nodes on the
frontier with the same minimum value of the evaluation function, the
speed of your search and the quality of the solution may depend on 
which one you select for expansion.<br><br>

</li><li> You will be graded primarily on the correctness of your solution, not on the
efficiency and elegance of your data structures. For example, we don't
care whether your priority queue or repeated state detection uses 
brute-force search, as long as you end up expanding (roughly) the 
correct number of nodes and find the optimal solution. So, feel free
to use "dumb" data structures as long as it makes your life easier
and still enables you to find the solutions to all the inputs in a reasonable
amount of time.

        <h2>Report Checklist</h2>

Your report should briefly describe
your implemented solution and fully answer the questions for every part of the assignment. Your description
should focus on the most "interesting" aspects of your solution, i.e., any non-obvious
implementation choices and parameter settings, and what you have found to be especially
important for getting good performance. Feel free to include pseudocode or figures if
they are needed to clarify your approach. Your report should be self-contained and it should
(ideally) make it possible for us to understand your solution without having to run your source code.
